## 📚 Book Tracker – Google Sheets Project
This is a Google Sheets-based Book Tracker that I built using advanced Excel functions and interactive data visualization techniques. It helps me organize, monitor, and reflect on my reading habits by tracking:

🔍 Features:
✅ Books Read, In Progress, and Not Started status

📅 Start & End Dates to track reading duration

⭐ Rating System with visual summary (bar chart)

📊 Books Read Per Month (line graph)

📘 Genre Distribution (interactive donut chart)

📈 Cumulative Reading Progress (timeline)

📄 Individual Book Details including:

1. Author
2. Recommended By
3. Total Pages
4. Genre
5. Personal Review
6. Status Progress Bar
7. "Who Should Read This?" suggestions

📈 Tech Highlights:

1. FILTER, SORT, ARRAYFORMULA, COUNTIF, TEXT, and other dynamic functions
2. Color-coded status bars, dropdown filters, and custom icons
3. Charts built natively in Google Sheets for a fully automated dashboard
4. No scripts or add-ons—just powerful spreadsheet logic!

💡 Why I Built This
To streamline my reading journey and apply analytical thinking to personal growth. It also showcases my data analysis and dashboarding skills using spreadsheet tools alone—no external BI platforms needed.
