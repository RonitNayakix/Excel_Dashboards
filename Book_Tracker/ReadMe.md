📈 Cumulative Reading Progress (timeline)

📄 Individual Book Details including:

  Author
  
  Recommended By
  
  Total Pages
  
  Genre
  
  Personal Review
  
  Status Progress Bar
  
  "Who Should Read This?" suggestions

📈 Tech Highlights:
FILTER, SORT, ARRAYFORMULA, COUNTIF, TEXT, and other dynamic functions
